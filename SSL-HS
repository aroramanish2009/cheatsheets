#SSL Handshake Explained
1. Client sends Hello, Cipher Suite and Client Random
  - If server can't see this the supported cipher suite then it will send failure alert and close the connection. 
2. Server responds back by sending the Server Random and SSL Certificate (Public Key)
  - Server will select highest supported TLS version.
  - Server will select cipher suite from the list sent by client. 
  - server will also send the certificate of the server with the certificate chain.
3. Client Verifies the SSL Certificate Information 
4. Client sends Pre-Master Key generated using the Public Key 
5. Server verifies Client Certificare (if required) 
6. Server decrypts Pre-Master Key using Private Key 
7. Master-Secret or Master-Key is established between Client and Server which will be used for Encryt/Decryt
